# API_Employee_Directory
A prototype for an employee directory. Built using a JSON object requested from the API using fetch. I parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
